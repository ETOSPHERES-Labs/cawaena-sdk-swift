# CryptPay Swift Package

This repository contains the Swift package for the Cawaena SDK.

## Usage

Simply add this repository in to the `dependencies` in the `Package.swift` file like so:
```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "program",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://gitlab.inovel.de/zd0006/cryptpay-swift", from: "0.0.1")
    ],
    targets: [
        .executableTarget(
            name: "main",
            dependencies: [
                .product(name: "CryptpaySdk", package: "cryptpay-swift")
            ]),
    ]
)
```

The `CryptpaySdk` module is then available for import in your project.

## Access

For the Swift Package Manager to be able to download the binaries stored in JFrog, you need to setup
an access token in your `~/.netrc` file. 

1. Visit [JFrog](https://repo.farmunited.com/) and log in. In the top right corner, click your name
   and then on _Edit Profile_. Under _Identity Tokens_ click _Generate an Identity Token_ and optionally
   give the token a name.

2.  If not already existing, create the file `.netrc` in your home folder and add the follwing lines (e.g. using `nano ~/.netrc`)
    ```
    machine repo.farmunited.com
        login <your JFrog username>
        password <your access token>
    ```
3. You should now be able to access and use the package in your Swift projects!
